Container uses and generates data folders which are available for container but not to the host machine. When the container gets restarted or crashed the data generated inside is deleted permanently. Docker volumes is a process of saving the data to the host machine from container.

### Docker data one time copy

Get the folder copied from container to host machine, this option useful for one time copy, but not recommended for the databases which needs the stateful behavior. Using `docker cp` we can copy the docker container volume to the host machine. 

`docker cp <CONTAINER_ID>:<PATH_OF_CONTAINER_DIR_TO_COPY> <DESTINATION_PATH_HOST_MACHINE>`

example: `docker cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf $PWD/`

### Docker Volume

Docker volume is a process of mounting the container volume to the host directory. This can be done in three ways. 
1. Anonymous Volumes
2. Named Volumes
3. Named Bind Volumes

Before getting hands on the volumes lets understand the `docker volume` command

```bash
docker volumes
```
Output:

```bash
Usage:	docker volume COMMAND

Manage volumes

Commands:
  create      Create a volume
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more volumes
  ls          List volumes
  prune       Remove all unused local volumes
  rm          Remove one or more volumes

Run 'docker volume COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

#### 1. Anonymous Volumes
