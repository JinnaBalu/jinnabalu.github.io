      <p>If you are still reading, the chances are that you are probably interested in the ‚Äúhowto‚Äù part of this all.
        Don‚Äôt
        worry, I‚Äôll provide tutorials on different subjects, like Analytics, Application Development, and
        Deployment,
        Messaging, Databases (SQL and NoSQL), DevOps, Monitoring, Security, Storage, Docker, Jenkins, Git, Gitlab,
        Github,
        Bitbucket, Jhipster, Microservices. Sharing of my configurations and stories about my experience working
        with the
        different techniques.</p>
      <p>I am working with different programming languages from the past few years, and working as a platform
        engineer in
        my day to day job. In my private time, I‚Äôm using this experience to give back my knowledge and time</p>

      <p>
        I also have a personal life (yeah really!). I‚Äôm a father of a 3-year-old baby girl üëß, a 1-year-old big boy
        üë∂, and the love of my life üíë.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I‚Äôm a nerd and I am proud of it. My life is a busy one. Being a family man, creating time for the people
        around me, having a full-time job, create time for my hobby, is like juggling ten balls at the same time. We all
        got the same 24 hours in a day and the time doesn‚Äôt wait or stop.</p>

      <p>Years ago I decided to become more productive in my life and started working on systems to achieve that
        goal. You‚Äôd probably had one (or more) of those todo-lists right? Yeah‚Ä¶ Thought so‚Ä¶ so did I. They grow, become
        obsolete, and eventually forgotten. But still many thoughts popping in my brain, some of them partially
        completed
        sitting in GitHub, some of them are at the initial stage stopped after creating JDL(UML), and some of them
        are
        sitting as stories on my google keep, which takes the whole day to read about all of them.</p>
      <p>I use a method called ‚ÄúGTD‚Äù (Getting Things Done) and developed my own habits and disciplines in the past
        years. Happy Productivity!</p>
